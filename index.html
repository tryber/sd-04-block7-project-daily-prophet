      <h1>Rony Weasley</h1>
      <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Ron would suffer much personal turmoil in his sixth year. Harry was named
        Gryffindor team captain. Ron was
        nervous about Quidditch try-outs, but beat out Cormac McLaggen in saves, partly because Hermione cast a
        Confundus
        Charm on McLaggen in retaliation for him insulting Ron and Ginny.</p>

      <p>Felix Felicis into Ron's pumpkin juice at breakfast. Harry even allowed Hermione to see the vial, so she
        would object to the cheating. This convinced Ron that he had an edge in the game, which caused him to play
        excellently. However, when after the match Harry revealed it was a trick.</p>

      <h1>Harry Potter vs Hungarian Horntail</h1>
      <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Around Hallowe'en, the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and
        Durmstrang Institute arrived at the school.
        The arrival of famous international Quidditch Star Viktor Krum caused a lot of excitement, particularly among
        girls. Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory were all chosen to represent their respective schools
        in this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor. This came as a shock for all
        those present, due to the fact that he was under-age and that he never entered his name into the Goblet of Fire
        during the selection process. Many people (even Ron and fellow Gryffindors) did not believe Harry's story. They
        thought this to be nothing but another attempt to gain even more fame and eternal glory. This caused extreme tension
        between the two friends and they did not speak again for a long time. Ron started spending more time with Dean
        Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.</p>

      <h1>Hermione Granger</h1>
      <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Before returning to Hogwarts, she and Ron learned that they had been appointed
        prefects for Gryffindor house, to
        the secret consternation of Harry, who couldn't believe Ron had been chosen over him. She took her position
        very seriously. Once the school year began, Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house-elves, though
        she was not as intense about S.P.E.W. as she had been the previous year. She learned how to knit socks and hats
        for the house-elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower, disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick
        the house-elves into accidentally freeing themselves.</p>
      <img src="./image/HermioneGranger.gif" alt="Hermione Granger">
      <p>The elves found this attempt insulting, and they stopped
        cleaning the Tower at all. Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made,
        and cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know. Hermione was challenged in more ways than one
        that year when she met Luna Lovegood, whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione.
        However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.</p>

        <p class="first-letter-uppercase">In a Care of Magical Creatures lesson, Draco unintentionally provoked the
          Hippogriff Buckbeak, and was injured,
          though he exaggerated how badly he was hurt for attention, and in an attempt to use the incident against
          Rubeus Hagrid to get him fired. When Draco mocked him for how upset he became over the case, Hermione slapped Draco
          in anger. Lucius tried to get the creature executed, and although he was successful in obtaining this sentence,
          Buckbeak was saved through the efforts of Harry and Hermione with the help of a time-turner, and given to
          Black when his innocence was proven to Harry, Ron and Hermione. This outcome angered both Draco and his
          father.
