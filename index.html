        <h1>Harry Potter vs Hungarian Horntail</h1>
        <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Around Hallowe'en, the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and
          Durmstrang Institute arrived at the
          school.
          The arrival of famous international Quidditch Star Viktor Krum caused a lot of excitement, particularly among
          girls. Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory were all chosen to represent their respective schools
          in
          this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor. This came as a shock for all
          those
          present, due to the fact that he was under-age and that he never entered his name into the Goblet of Fire
          during
          the selection process. Many people (even Ron and fellow Gryffindors) did not believe Harry's story. They
          thought
          this to be nothing but another attempt to gain even more fame and eternal glory. This caused extreme tension
          between the two friends and they did not speak again for a long time. Ron started spending more time with Dean
          Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.</p>

        <h1>Rony Weasley<span class="font-zero"> and our time in Hogwarts</span></h1>
        <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Ron would suffer much personal turmoil in his sixth year. Harry was named
          Gryffindor team captain. Ron was
          nervous about Quidditch try-outs, but beat out Cormac McLaggen in saves, partly because Hermione cast a
          Confundus
          Charm on McLaggen in retaliation for him insulting Ron and Ginny.</p>

          would
          object to the cheating. This convinced Ron that he had an edge in the game, which caused him to play
          excellently.
          However, when after the match Harry revealed it was a trick.</p>

        <h1>Hermione Granger<span class="font-zero"> and our time in Hogwarts</span></h1>
        <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Before returning to Hogwarts, she and Ron learned that they had been appointed
          prefects for Gryffindor house, to
          the secret consternation of Harry, who couldn't believe Ron had been chosen over him. She took her position
          very
          seriously. Once the school year began, Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house-elves, though
          she
          was not as intense about S.P.E.W. as she had been the previous year. She learned how to knit socks and hats
          for
          the house-elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower, disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick
          the
          house-elves into accidentally freeing themselves.</p>
        <img src="./image/HermioneGranger.gif" alt="Hermione Granger">
        <p>The elves found this attempt insulting, and they stopped
          cleaning the Tower at all. Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made,
          and
          cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know. Hermione was challenged in more ways than one
          that year when she met Luna Lovegood, whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione.
          However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.</p>

            <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Ginny returned to Hogwarts on 1 September, 1995 with her brothers. During
              the train ride on the Hogwarts
              Express, Ginny introduced Harry and Neville to Luna Lovegood, a Ravenclaw in her year. With the arrival of
              new
              Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge and a theory-based course, Harry, Ron, and Hermione
              decided to form a study group to teach practical defence spells. She joined the group, bringing her
              boyfriend
              Michael with her and several other Ravenclaws. They all met in the Hog's Head where Ginny first
              demonstrated her
              sense of humour by mimicking Umbridge's cough. During the first official meeting of the group, she came up
              with
              the name for the group — Dumbledore's Army,</p>

            <p class="first-letter-uppercase">When Harry, Ron, and Hermione began organising Dumbledore's Army, Neville was among the first to sign up. At their first meeting in the Room of Requirement, Neville was left partner-less when they
              began practise; Neville instead partnered with Harry. After successfully disarming Harry, Neville then joined Ron and Hermione, so Harry could check on the others. With Harry's encouragement,

            <p class="first-letter-uppercase">In Luna's fourth year, she met and befriended Harry Potter, Ronald
              Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville
              Longbottom. She believed Harry's declaration that Lord Voldemort was back. As the year progressed, she was
              invited to join an underground Defence Against the Dark Arts group called Dumbledore's Army, that was
              taught and
              led by Harry Potter. This organisation was to teach practical defence. She eagerly accepted, working hard
              along
              with the others and enjoying their company. In an effort to make people believe Harry's story, Hermione
              arranged
              an interview for him with Rita Skeeter at the Three Broomsticks — Luna accompanied them so as to persuade
              her
              father to publish the interview in The Quibbler. The copy sold out, every Hogwarts student and possibly
              every
              professor as well, read the copy because of the Education Decree that stated that it was banned on school

            Hippogriff Buckbeak, and was injured,
            though he exaggerated how badly he was hurt for attention, and in an attempt to use the incident against
            Rubeus
            Hagrid to get him fired. When Draco mocked him for how upset he became over the case, Hermione slapped Draco
            in
            anger. Lucius tried to get the creature executed, and although he was successful in obtaining this sentence,
            Buckbeak was saved through the efforts of Harry and Hermione with the help of a time-turner, and given to
            Black
            when his innocence was proven to Harry, Ron and Hermione. This outcome angered both Draco and his
            father.
