    <h1>Harry Potter<span class="font-zero"> and our time in Hogwarts</span></h1>
    <img src="./image/HarryPotter.gif" alt="">
    <p>Around Hallowe'en, the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and Durmstrang Institute arrived at the school.
      The arrival of famous international Quidditch Star Viktor Krum caused a lot of excitement, particularly among
      girls. Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory were all chosen to represent their respective schools in
      this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor. This came as a shock for all those
      present, due to the fact that he was under-age and that he never entered his name into the Goblet of Fire during
      the selection process. Many people (even Ron and fellow Gryffindors) did not believe Harry's story. They thought
      this to be nothing but another attempt to gain even more fame and eternal glory. This caused extreme tension
      between the two friends and they did not speak again for a long time. Ron started spending more time with Dean
      Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.</p>

    <p>Ron would suffer much personal turmoil in his sixth year. Harry was named Gryffindor team captain. Ron was
      nervous about Quidditch try-outs, but beat out Cormac McLaggen in saves, partly because Hermione cast a Confundus

      However, when after the match Harry revealed it was a trick.</p>

    <p>Before returning to Hogwarts, she and Ron learned that they had been appointed prefects for Gryffindor house, to
      the secret consternation of Harry, who couldn't believe Ron had been chosen over him. She took her position very
      seriously. Once the school year began, Hermione resumed some of her activism on behalf of house-elves, though she
      was not as intense about S.P.E.W. as she had been the previous year. She learned how to knit socks and hats for
      the house-elves and hid them in Gryffindor Tower, disguising them with crumpled rubbish in an attempt to trick the
      house-elves into accidentally freeing themselves. The elves found this attempt insulting, and they stopped
      cleaning the Tower at all. Dobby was the only one who enjoyed the gifts, took everything Hermione had made, and
      cleaned the Tower by himself, a fact which Hermione didn't know. Hermione was challenged in more ways than one
      that year when she met Luna Lovegood, whose belief in many things without logical grounds baffled Hermione.
      However, the two became friends after accepting one another's differences.</p>

      <img src="./image/GInaWeasley.gif" alt="">
      <p>Ginny returned to Hogwarts on 1 September, 1995 with her brothers. During the train ride on the Hogwarts
        Express, Ginny introduced Harry and Neville to Luna Lovegood, a Ravenclaw in her year. With the arrival of new
        Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge and a theory-based course, Harry, Ron, and Hermione
        decided to form a study group to teach practical defence spells. She joined the group, bringing her boyfriend
        Michael with her and several other Ravenclaws. They all met in the Hog's Head where Ginny first demonstrated her
        sense of humour by mimicking Umbridge's cough. During the first official meeting of the group, she came up with
        the name for the group — Dumbledore's Army,</p>

      <h1>Neville Longbottom<span class="font-zero"> and our time in Hogwarts</span></h1>
      <img src="./image/NevilleLongbotton.gif" alt="">
      <p>When Harry, Ron, and Hermione began organising Dumbledore's Army, Neville was among the first to sign up. At
        their first meeting in the Room of Requirement, Neville was left partner-less when they began practise; Neville
        instead partnered with Harry. After successfully disarming Harry, Neville then joined Ron and Hermione, so Harry
        could check on the others.[36] With Harry's encouragement, by the beginning of Christmas break, Neville had
        improved "beyond all recognition." StMungos PM B5C23M1 ChristmasAtStMungos Moment Neville and his grandmother
        visiting St Mungo's
        During Christmas break, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny learned that Neville's parents were not dead, but patients in
        St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, having gone insane after being tortured by a group of
        Death Eaters at the end of the First Wizarding War. Harry was the only one who already knew this, having found
        out in the Pensieve in 1994, but he had told no one, keeping Neville's secret safe. Before Neville left, his
        mother handed him an empty Droobles Blowing Gum wrapper; while his grandmother wanted him to throw it away,
        Neville instead pocketed it.[38]
        When it was learned that ten Death Eaters escaped from Azkaban in 1996, including three of the ones responsible
        for the torture of Neville's parents, Neville did not speak of it, but it "wrought a strange and even slightly
        alarming change" in him, according to Harry. He worked harder than anyone in D.A. meetings, and was the fastest
        to pick up new spells aside from Hermione</p>

      <img src="./image/LunaLoveggod.gif" alt="">
      <p>In Luna's fourth year, she met and befriended Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Neville
        Longbottom. She believed Harry's declaration that Lord Voldemort was back. As the year progressed, she was
        invited to join an underground Defence Against the Dark Arts group called Dumbledore's Army, that was taught and
        led by Harry Potter. This organisation was to teach practical defence. She eagerly accepted, working hard along
        with the others and enjoying their company. In an effort to make people believe Harry's story, Hermione arranged
        an interview for him with Rita Skeeter at the Three Broomsticks — Luna accompanied them so as to persuade her
        father to publish the interview in The Quibbler. The copy sold out, every Hogwarts student and possibly every
        professor as well, read the copy because of the Education Decree that stated that it was banned on school
        grounds.</p>

      <p>In a Care of Magical Creatures lesson, Draco unintentionally provoked the Hippogriff Buckbeak, and was injured,
        though he exaggerated how badly he was hurt for attention, and in an attempt to use the incident against Rubeus
        Hagrid to get him fired. When Draco mocked him for how upset he became over the case, Hermione slapped Draco in
        anger. Lucius tried to get the creature executed, and although he was successful in obtaining this sentence,
        Buckbeak was saved through the efforts of Harry and Hermione with the help of a time-turner, and given to Black
        when his innocence was proven to Harry, Ron and Hermione .[15] This outcome angered both Draco and his father.
