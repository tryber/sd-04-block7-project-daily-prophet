      <h1>Harry Potter vs Hungarian Horntail</h1>
      <p class="first-letter-uppercase">Around Hallowe'en, the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and
        Durmstrang Institute arrived at the school.
        The arrival of famous international Quidditch Star Viktor Krum caused a lot of excitement, particularly among
        girls. Viktor Krum, Fleur Delacour, and Cedric Diggory were all chosen to represent their respective schools
        in this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor. This came as a shock for all
        those present, due to the fact that he was under-age and that he never entered his name into the Goblet of Fire
        during the selection process. Many people (even Ron and fellow Gryffindors) did not believe Harry's story. They
        thought this to be nothing but another attempt to gain even more fame and eternal glory. This caused extreme tension
        between the two friends and they did not speak again for a long time. Ron started spending more time with Dean
        Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.</p>

        <p class="first-letter-uppercase">In a Care of Magical Creatures lesson, Draco unintentionally provoked the
          Hippogriff Buckbeak, and was injured,
          though he exaggerated how badly he was hurt for attention, and in an attempt to use the incident against
          Rubeus Hagrid to get him fired. When Draco mocked him for how upset he became over the case, Hermione slapped Draco
          in anger. Lucius tried to get the creature executed, and although he was successful in obtaining this sentence,
          Buckbeak was saved through the efforts of Harry and Hermione with the help of a time-turner, and given to
          Black when his innocence was proven to Harry, Ron and Hermione. This outcome angered both Draco and his
          father.
