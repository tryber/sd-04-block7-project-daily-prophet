                        harness the power of

                        But perhaps the strangest thing about the witches and wizards of the Harry Potter universe
                        is
                        that despite all their magic, they still rely on old-fashioned print media for their news.</p>

                                generally use the internet, and rival publications are virtually non-existent. (No,

                        better, despite the countless
                        Instagram opportunities that would come with living in an enchanted castle – made-up stories
                        travel fast by word of mouth (or owl.) The students are so insulated from the outside world, the
                        house system often immersing them in an echo chamber of their peers, they frequently have no way
                        to fact-check rumours and form rational opinions about current events.
                        When the Ministry of Magic flatly refuses to believe that Voldemort has
                        returned – and uses the
                        Prophet to smear Harry and Dumbledore – most students and their parents have no choice but to
                        believe it. “ALL IS WELL”, the Prophet’s front page proclaims, asking pointedly whether Harry is
                        now “The boy who lies?”</p>

                    <p class="article-animation">After Voldemort’s followers take over the Ministry, the Prophet stops
                        reporting deaths the Death
                        Eaters are responsible for and starts printing more fake stories – including a claim that
                        muggle-born wizards steal their magical powers from pure-bloods.
                        We are certainly more likely to believe fake news when it confirms our
                        personal biases,
                        regardless of
                        how intelligently or critically we think we look at the world. Could this explain why, at the
                        start
                        of last week, thousands of social media users gleefully retweeted a Daily Mail front page
                        calling on
                        Theresa May to step down that was blatantly a poorly-edited fake?</p>

                    <p class="article-animation">The non-stop Hogwarts rumour mill illustrates the damage that a dearth
                        of reliable sources of
                        information can cause to public debate. But at the other end of the scale, the saturation of
                        news on
                        the muggle internet means it can also be hugely challenging to separate fact from fiction.
                        No one is totally free from bias – even those people or sources whose
                        opinions we share. In this
                        world of alternative facts, it is crucial to remember that all stories are presented in a
                        certain
                        way for a reason – whether that’s to advance a political argument, reaffirm and promote the
                        writer’s
                        own worldview, or stop an inconvenient teenage wizard from interfering with the Ministry of
                        Magic’s
                        plans.
