                <p class="text">
                    What are mugglers really like? Do mugglers dream of electric sheep? These and many more questions are discussed
                    with the top authorities in the fiel of modern muggler studies. Is it possible that mugglers are not too different
                    form ourselves? Can we in fact learn from the fate of our underdeveloped cousins?

                    <p class="subtitle"> About a month ago, the internet started to list. Up to that point, online activity flowed more or less
                        in balance, with work traffic relegated mostly to the business side of the ship. Then social-distancing
                        directives forced much of the serious stuff over to the starboard side. Which is where we watch Netflix.

                    <p class="subtitle">
                        As it happens, the country’s internet infrastructure has proven robust enough to handle the wholesale
                        shift. Unfortunately, it’s a different story for many homes with older Wi-Fi routers that weren’t
                        equipped to handle the onslaught. If your work videoconference is struggling to keep pace because it’s
                        crowded out by your spouse’s team meeting and the kids’ virtual classes, then take heart. Help is on the way.
