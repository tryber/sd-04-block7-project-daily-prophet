      <p class="par1">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them brought Newt Scamander
         across the Atlantic to New York City, the first time the Harry Potter
         franchise showed us magical life in America. The British-born magizoologist and his
         friends then traveled back to Europe in The Crimes of Grindelwald, letting us explore the
         wizarding world of Paris, France. Now we know which never-before-seen magical place the next
         movie will visit. Wizards, witches, and jolly bakers named Jacob alike will be taking the battle
         against Gellert Grindelwald to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, home to one of the oldest and most
         prestigious schools of magic in the world, one that might be getting a visit from a famous
         American professor.</p>

      <p>According to Entertainment Weekly, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling is writing the script, and the main cast of the first films,

          <p class="article-animation">Fantastic Beasts has been stealing millions of hearts across the world, but people especially
            liked one little thief that couldn't resist going after valuables. Thanks to Aisha Voya, people
            can now own their personal Niffler (or at least a necklace version of him)!
